# Hello there, I'm Lucas! 👋

I'm currently a student at 42 LeHavre, the previous year, I earned a Diploma of College Studies (DCS) at Cégep de La Pocatière in Québec, specializing in Game Development. Prior to that, I completed a BTS SIO (IT Services for Organizations) at StJoSup Le Havre with a focus on SLAM (Software Solutions and Business Applications) and I am actively seeking an apprenticeship contract starting in September 2025.
